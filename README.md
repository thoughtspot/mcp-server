## Stdio support (fallback)

If you are unable to use the remote MCP server due to connectivity restrictions on your Thoughtspot instance. You could use the `stdio` local transport using the `npm` package.

Here is how to configure `stdio` with MCP Client:

```json 
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ThoughtSpot": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
         "@thoughtspot/mcp-server"
      ],
      "env": {
         "TS_INSTANCE": "<your Thoughtspot Instance URL>",
         "TS_AUTH_TOKEN": "<ThoughtSpot Access Token>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### How to obtain a `TS_AUTH_TOKEN` ?

- Go to ThoughtSpot => _Develop_ => _Rest Playground v2.0_
- _Authentication_ => _Get Full access token_
- Scroll down and expand the "body"
- Add your "username" and "password".
- Put whatever "validity_time" you want the token to be.
- Click on "Try it out" on the bottom right.
- You should get a token in the response, thats the bearer token.

#### Alternative way to get `TS_AUTH_TOKEN`
- Login to the ThoughtSpot instance as you would normally.
- Opem in a new tab this URL:
  - https://<your-ts-instance>/api/rest/2.0/auth/session/token
- You will see a JSON response, copy the "token" value (without the quotes).
- This is the token you could use.

### Troubleshooting

> Oauth errors due to CORS/SAML.

Make sure to add the following entries in your ThoughtSpot instance:

*CORS*

- Go to ThoughtSpot => _Develop_ => Security settings
- Click "Edit"
- Add "agent.thoughtspot.app" to the the "CORS whitelisted domains". 

*SAML*

- Go to ThoughtSpot => _Develop_
- Go to "All Orgs" Tab on the left panel if there is one.
- Click "Security settings"
- Click "Edit"
- Add "agent.thoughtspot.app" to the the "SAML redirect domains".
